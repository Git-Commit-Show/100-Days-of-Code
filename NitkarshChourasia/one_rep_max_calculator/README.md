# One-Rep Max Calculator

This repository contains two Python programs that can calculate the estimated one-repetition maximum (1RM) for a weightlifting exercise. The 1RM is the maximum amount of weight that you can lift for one rep. It is useful for tracking your strength progress and planning your training.

## Command-line version

The file `one_rep_max_calculator.py` is a command-line version of the 1RM calculator. It prompts the user to enter the weight lifted and the number of reps performed, and then calculates and displays the estimated 1RM based on the *Epley formula*.

To run this program, you need Python 3 installed on your system. You can execute the program by typing `python one_rep_max_calculator.py` in your terminal.

## Graphical user interface version

The file `one_rep_max_calculator_gui.py` is a graphical user interface version of the 1RM calculator. It uses Tkinter to create a window with entry fields, labels, and a button. The user can input the weight lifted and the number of reps performed, and then click the calculate button to see the estimated 1RM based on the Epley formula.

To run this program, you need Python 3 and Tkinter installed on your system. You can execute the program by typing `python one_rep_max_calculator_gui.py` in your terminal.
