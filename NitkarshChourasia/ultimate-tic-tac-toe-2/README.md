# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe 2

This is a revised version of the game [I](https://github.com/PBJI) previously developed back in 2021. Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a board game composed of nine tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3 Ã— 3 grid. Players take turns playing on the smaller tic-tac-toe boards until one of them wins on the larger board. Compared to traditional tic-tac-toe, strategy in this game is conceptually more difficult and has proven more challenging for computers.

## How to play

To play the game, you need to clone this repository and install the dependencies using `npm install`. Then, you can run the game using `npm start`. You can choose to play against another human player or against the bot. The rules of the game are as follows:

- The first player is X and the second player is O.
- On each turn, the player marks one of the small squares within one of the nine sub-boards.
- The choice of sub-board for the next move is determined by the previous move.
- If the sub-board where the next move must be made is already won or tied, then the player can choose any other sub-board instead.
- The game is won by the player who wins three sub-boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or by the player who wins the most sub-boards if all of them are filled.
