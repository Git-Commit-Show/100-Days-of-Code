 - Today I continued my Junit testing course i couldn't finish today but i continued and finished in the early hours of the next day. I also tried reolving the code duplication and coverage issues on sonarqube but i paused it to finish the testing course, I also tried setting up the eclipse jkube open source project but its throwing error just after just pulling the project, so i just reported it on their gitter chat. I also worked on creating my side hustle on teespring(created two designs but both got rejected due to conflict with another design that i know nothing about but we continue again 2moro)
